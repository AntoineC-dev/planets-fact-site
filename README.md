## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox / Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [Animejs](https://animejs.com/)

### What I learned

#### Animejs

Very neat js library for animations. See below the shooting stars animation fn:

```ts
const shootingstars = document.getElementById('shootingstars') as HTMLDivElement;

const animateStars = () =>
  anime({
    targets: ['.star'],
    easing: 'linear',
    loop: true,
    delay: (_, i) => 3000 * i,
    opacity: [{ duration: 100, value: '1' }],
    width: [{ value: '150px' }, { value: '0px' }],
    translateX: 350,
  });
```
